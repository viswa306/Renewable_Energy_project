Rutgers Bootcamp Project 2 - Renewable Energy

### About the Project
* In this project, we analyzed 3 key points
* 1.We found that renewable energy generation is increased most of the countries during the past 20 years in the world .
* 2.We uncovered the effects of Renewable Energy on Air pollution and Death Rate 
* 3. We observed how the GDP per capita of each country would change the generation and consumption of Renewable Energy.
In conclusion, according to the article by International Renewable Energy Agency(IRENA), as populations expand, living standards improve, and consumption rises, total demand for energy is expected to increase by 21% by 2030. In addition to this, growing concerns over climate change are prompting governments worldwide to seek ways to supply energy while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts.
